      },
      {
        "q": "Can I lock specific 4G/LTE bands?",
        "a": "Yes. If your modem's firmware supports it, the app allows you to select and lock specific frequency bands to improve signal stability or speed."
      },
      {
        "q": "Does the app track data usage accurately?",
        "a": "The app fetches data consumption statistics directly from the modem. While highly accurate, we recommend cross-checking with your provider's official dashboard for billing purposes."
      },
      {
        "q": "How does the Signal Finder work?",
        "a": "Signal Finder provides real-time RSRP, RSRQ, and SINR readings with visual and audio feedback, making it easier to find the optimal physical placement for your modem."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can I manage SMS through the app?",
        "a": "Yes. You can read, send, and even perform multi-select deletion of SMS messages directly from the app interface if your modem supports it."
      },
      {
        "q": "Is my modem password safe?",
        "a": "Absolutely. Your credentials are stored securely on your device and are only used locally to communicate with your modem. No data is ever sent to external servers."
      },
      {
        "q": "Is this app free?",
        "a": "Yes, this app is free and open source. You can download and use it at no cost."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can this app work with the latest Huawei modems?",
        "a": "Yes, this app can work with latest Huawei modems. However, please note that not all Huawei modems support all features of this app. Some features may not be available on certain modems."
